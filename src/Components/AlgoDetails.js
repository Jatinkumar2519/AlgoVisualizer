            description: `Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high. We sort the array using multiple passes. After the first pass, 
the maximum element goes to end (its correct position). Same way, after second pass, the second largest element goes to second last position and so on. In every pass, 
we process only those elements that have already not moved to correct position. After k passes, the largest k elements must have been moved to the last k positions. 
In a pass, we consider remaining elements and compare all adjacent and swap if larger element is before a smaller element.If we keep doing this, we get the largest 
(among the remaining elements) at its correct position.`,

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:

1. Divide:  Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided. 
2. Conquer:  Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm. 
3. Merge:  The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged. `,

It works on the principle of divide and conquer, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.`,
            pseudocode:`
// Dividing
function QuickSort(array, low, high):
    if low < high:
        // Partition the array and get the pivot index
        pivotIndex = Partition(array, low, high)

        // Recursively sort elements before and after the pivot
        QuickSort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1)
        QuickSort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high)
// finding pivot 
// pivot is a element such that the smaller numbers are on left side of the pivot and greater on the right side

function Partition(array, low, high): // Choose the last element as the pivot pivot = array[high] i = low - 1 // Index of smaller element
for j = low to high - 1:
    if array[j] <= pivot:
        i = i + 1
        Swap(array[i], array[j])`,
            working:`
There are mainly three steps in the algorithm:

1. Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).
2. Partition the Array: Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.
3. Recursively Call: Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).
4. Base Case: The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.`,

It can be seen as an optimization over selection sort where we first find the max (or min) element and swap it with the last (or first). We repeat the same process for the remaining elements. In Heap Sort, we use Binary Heap so that we can quickly find and move the max element in O(Log n) instead of O(n) and hence achieve the O(n Log n) time complexity.`,

            working:`
First convert the array into a max heap using heapify, Please note that this happens in-place. The array elements are re-arranged to follow heap properties. 
Then one by one delete the root node of the Max-heap and replace it with the last node and heapify. Repeat this process while size of heap is greater than 1.
1. Rearrange array elements so that they form a Max Heap.
2. Repeat the following steps until the heap contains only one element:
    2.1. Swap the root element of the heap (which is the largest element in current heap) with the last element of the heap.
    2.2. Remove the last element of the heap (which is now in the correct position). We mainly reduce heap size and do not remove element from the actual array.
    2.3. Heapify the remaining elements of the heap.
3. Finally we get sorted array.`,
