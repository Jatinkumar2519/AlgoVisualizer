The linear search algorithm, also known as sequential search, is a fundamental method for locating a specific element within a list or array.

1. Initialization: The search begins at the first element of the list (typically at index 0).
2. Comparison: The current element is compared with the target value being searched for.
3. Match Found: If the current element matches the target, the search is successful, and the index or position of the found element is returned. The algorithm then terminates.
4. No Match: If the current element does not match the target, the search proceeds to the next element in the list. 
5. Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated for each subsequent element until either a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
6. Element Not Found: If the end of the list is reached without finding the target element, the search is unsuccessful, and a special value (e.g., -1 or null) is returned to indicate that the element is not present`,

1. Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).
2. Partition the Array: Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.
3. Recursively Call: Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).
4. Base Case: The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.`,
